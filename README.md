## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This components were made with HTML and was styled with CSS using the colors provided in the client's style guide.  JavaScript was used to provide the logic to see who won, keep score, and keep track of click events.

## Lessons Learned:

This is one where the familiarity of the game almost gave me too much confidence.  I later found that drawing my own sketches helped cement it in my mind and I was able to go forth and finish.
